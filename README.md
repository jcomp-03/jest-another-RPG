  # jest Another RPG
  ## Project Description
  This app demonstrates a foray into fundamental programming paradigms such as object-oriented programming (OOP) and test-driven development (TDD), or using automated testing to verify one's code works as expected. The JavaScript testing framework used in this app is Jest,  which was developed by Facebook and is well-documented. Mocking data is also implemented to nullify the concern about isolation testing as regards players and potions. The focus on OOP in this app lies in creating several different classes, a parent class and several children classes which "extend" from their parent, allowing the children to inherit methods and properties from the parent. Constructor functions allow for the creation of instances of the different objects--in this case, the Game constructor which begins a new game, the Player and Enemy constructors which create instances of player and enemy objects, and the Potion constructor which allows for the creation of potions with various effects.
